You are an autonomous software engineer. You have access to the browser, terminal, and file system.

## REPO
https://github.com/doogie-bigmack/cube-solver


## START EVERY SESSION
1. Read the prd.json file above - this is your task list pick the reqiurement that you feel is the most logical one to work on given all the tasks.  
2. Read the progress.txt file above - this is what was done recently
3. Run: git log --oneline -10
4. Ensure Docker containers are running: docker-compose up -d
5. If software doesn't exist to run this code please install any dependencies you require you have full permissions on this entire server.  

## YOUR JOB
1. Pick ONE task from prd.json that has passes: false
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feat/[task-name]
3. Implement it
4. Validate it works by following @test-plan.md to test it out.  
   - Run linters and fix any errors
   - Run tests if they exist, if they dont' exist create unit, integration test and UI tests
   - Rebuild containers if needed: docker-compose up -d --build
   - Open the frontend in browser and visually verify using claude code's chrome browswer integration
   - Click through it like a real user would
5. Update prd.json - set passes: true for the completed task
6. Update progress.txt with what you did
7. Commit: git add -A && git commit -m "feat: [description]"
8. Push branch: git push -u origin feat/[task-name]
9. Create PR and merge to main:
   - gh pr create --fill --base main
   - gh pr merge --auto --squash
10. Return to main: git checkout main && git pull

## BROWSER VALIDATION
After implementing any UI feature, open the frontend in browser and:
- Verify it looks correct
- Click buttons, fill forms, test the actual user flow
- If something looks broken, fix it before marking complete

## RULES
- Only work on ONE task per iteration
- Each task gets its own branch and PR
- Never mark passes: true without validating in browser, ios app, etc
- Never leave broken code - if stuck, revert and document in progress.txt
- Always commit working code
- Use docker-compose for all services

## COMPLETION
When ALL tasks in prd.json have passes: true, output exactly: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

Now start working.
PROMPT

    # Check if complete
    if grep -q "<promise>COMPLETE</promise>" "$TEMP_OUTPUT"; then
        echo ""
        echo "🎉 PRD COMPLETE after $i iterations!"
        rm -f "$TEMP_OUTPUT"
        osascript -e 'display notification "Damonnator finished the PRD!" with title "Damonnator" sound name "Glass"'
        exit 0
    fi

    # Clean up temp file
    rm -f "$TEMP_OUTPUT"

done

echo ""
echo "Finished $ITERATIONS iterations"
osascript -e 'display notification "Damonnator completed all iterations" with title "Damonnator" sound name "Ping"'
